# Artificial-Intelligence-Machine-Learning


1> Implements the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to classify data and evaluates its accuracy.

2> Demonstrates the use of the K-Means clustering algorithm to group data points into distinct clusters.

3> Explores the application of mutation in genetic algorithms, focusing on how mutations affect the evolution of a chromosome.

4> Implements algorithms to find the shortest path in a graph, commonly used in network optimization and route planning.

5> Solves the classic N-Queens problem using various algorithmic approaches, including backtracking and optimization techniques.
